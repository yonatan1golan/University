Jim Cramer is such a blowhard. Do remember when he called Elon a big thinker? I shake my head most of the time when I watch him.,2021-08-08 14:47:12+00:00,1,0,[]

Although Elon is over optimistic in terms of timeline, he always delivers. Every single time.\n\n\n- It's hard to be an entrepreneur without being optimistic, hence over promising.  Being in a capital intensive industry, creating bleeding edge technology while battling the dealership assoc assholes doesn't help.

Now the stock is back to where it was, and he owns $0.\n\nIf he puts buy pressure on it again, it'll just make it go back up again to where it's at right now.\n\nHowever, you do have a point... and that's the stock only actually moved when it was announced he made his buy move of 9%, not before.
