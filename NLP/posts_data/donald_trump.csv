Megathread: President Trump Directed His Attorney To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project,2019-01-18 03:56:54+00:00,84476,29115,"[{'author': 'slakmehl', 'body': '#UPDATE: **Mueller has gone on the record to deny the characterization of Cohen\'s testimony**. Here is their statement:\n\n>""BuzzFeed\'s\' description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate.""\n\nMy reading of legal expert consensus on twitter is that BuzzFeed\'s law enforcement sources were likely not prosecutors (and certainly not Mueller\'s office), and were over-stating the conclusiveness with which documentary evidence demonstrated Trump\'s ""direction"" of specific perjury. This is only relevant to the first quoted section of the my comment below (which is unaltered).\n\n----------------------------\n\nSince I put a lot of work into this, copying from the original thread:\n\nThis is a cover-up of a deal Trump was negotiating not with ""Russian businessmen"", but **directly with the Kremlin**, and was worth more than the last 20 years of Trump Org building projects combined.\n\n>Now the two [federal law enforcement officials] have told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, **the president personally instructed him to lie** — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.\n\n[This was a felony to which Michael Cohen has already pled guilty](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/michael-cohen-expected-plead-guilty-lying-congress-collusion/story?id=59491450), and they aren\'t just taking Cohen\'s word for it that Trump directed the crime. They appear to have a lot of evidence:\n\n>""The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through...**internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.""**\n\nThis is called suborning false statements, and constitutes Obstruction of Justice, **according to none other that current Attorney General nominee William Barr**, as directly stated [in his infamous memo to DoJ and Trump\'s lawyers](https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/1086095561722347520) that likely won him the job in the first place:\n\n>Thus, for example, if a President knowingly destroys or alters evidence, **suborns perjury, or induces a witness to change testimony...then he, like anyone else commits the crime of obstruction**\n\n\nHe reconfirmed this in his confirmation hearing just yesterday. [At the 2:27:02 Mark](https://www.c-span.org/video/?456626-1/attorney-general-nominee-william-barr-confirmation-hearing#&start=8840):\n\n>KLOBUCHAR: Okay.

I\'ll just take a couple seconds to see if I can help clarify this.
