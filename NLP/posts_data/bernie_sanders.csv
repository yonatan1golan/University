In the Army, if you don\'t spend your unit\'s budget for the year, the DoD figures you won\'t need the same or more for the following year so they\'ll reduce it. This is bad. What happens when you have new soldiers to train or want to do a fun training exercise that\'d make your dudes ready for war that following year? Sorry, don\'t have the budget. Anyways, this is a preface.\n\nI remember a time when my under-strength unit had 18k, as in thousand, rounds of 5.56 left plus 2k .50 cal. If we didn\'t fire it off, it\'d be reduced. Key words above is ""under-strength"". We ended up getting full up strength the following year. But I digress; my platoon went to the field for 5 days. 2 days was training with live ammo where I learned things. The other 3 was firing cyclic at nothing and collecting brass for turn-in.\n\nAnother reason for doing this at the end of every exercise for any spare ammo is you have to send an unlucky platoon to count every live round by hand while the platoon leader has to do a literal mountain of paperwork. Imagine you\'ve been crapping in a hole in the rain and cold for 14 days and you want to go home because you\'re tired and you\'ve not showered for two weeks. Would you like spending another six hours doing all of that and have to go through the lengthy procedures of storing weapons, vehicles, and nods? I didn\'t think so. In service terminology it is called a ""SPENDEX"". Short for spending exercise. \n\nJust for that ammo at $.50 cents per 5.56 and $2.50 for .50 BMG, that is $14G\'s that was mostly spent shooting the air. Not including gas, MREs, wet wipes, weapon PMCS, vehicle PMCS, and manhours for 60 servicemen and women for 14 days.\n\nNow imagine this story repeated across the army to every platoon every quarter. There are hundreds or thousands of combat platoons not including non-combat people who have to qualify. At the end of the day, soldiers are human and they want to just go home after training. It isn\'t rocket science. The DoD actively enforces policies that encourage soldiers to be extremely wasteful. Would you recycle your plastic if the government forced you to write a 20 page essay on the benefits of recycling every time you wanted to drop it off? Sure, ammo and explosives are dangerous. But if the entire system is made to encourage you to waste it, then why wouldn\'t you?', 'score': 3}, {'author': 'camz_47', 'body': 'Imagine you own a business and the government audited you 7 times and every time you failed\n\nOr better yet, imagine you never paid any taxes on that business for seven years\n\nWould you as a private citizen be allowed to still operate?', 'score': 3}, {'author': 'Puzzleheaded_Law_481', 'body': ""They waste so much money it's incredible."", 'score': 2}, {'author': 'arckeid', 'body': 'This shit only increases the conpiracies around the 09-11 especially the one that hit the pentagon.', 'score': 2}, {'author': 'downloadking007', 'body': 'Imagine that, Sanders, the voice of reason for the Democratic Party.', 'score': 2}, {'author': 'FatHighKnee', 'body': 'The gross part is why did it take elon musk mentioning it in order for bernie or anyone to care about it?
