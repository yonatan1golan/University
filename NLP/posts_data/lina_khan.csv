This is part of a stepped-up effort at both the FTC and the Justice Department to scrutinize private equity’s multiyear binge of buying up and consolidating all sorts of health care businesses, from nursing homes to hospices. But Khan’s most significant effort to discourage corporate gigantism isn’t about mergers or private equity at all. It’s an antitrust lawsuit brought last week by the FTC and 17 state attorneys general against her longtime bête noire, Amazon.\n\n>The FTC’s lawsuit points out that Amazon takes close to half of every dollar on every third-party sale, with one seller saying, “We have nowhere else to go, and Amazon knows it.” Farmers said much the same thing about railroads in the nineteenth century. Until 2019, Amazon bound suppliers contractually from selling their products at lower prices on other platforms. Now Amazon just puts such products at the bottom of its search results. Amazon’s search function, the lawsuit argues, is a mess, choked with advertisements and prioritizing its own often-inferior products. I’ve actually noticed this. Searching for a product on Amazon these days is like shouting at a very deaf store clerk “Please get me X” only to have the clerk show you three entirely irrelevant items because he can’t hear a word you say.\n\n>One difficulty with the Amazon lawsuit, as Camilla Hodgson pointed out last week in the Financial Times, is that although sellers, with good reason, hate Amazon, consumers love it. “You just could not be going after a more popular corporation,” David Balto, a former FTC policy director, told Hodgson. It’s true! Even granting that its search function is all crapped up, I still love Amazon, and I use it a lot.
