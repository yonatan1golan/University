This force is associated with the fields and particles called ‚Äúgluons‚Äù.\n\nThe **Weak Nuclear Force** (a force which affects most known particles but is too weak to hold any known thing together; its main effect is to cause many types of particles to decay to other particles, and to allow production and observation of neutrinos.)  This force is associated with the fields and particles called ‚ÄúW‚Äù and ‚ÄúZ‚Äù.\n\nThe **Higgs Force** (an extremely weak force, not yet observed, which we expect to be present, now that a [and perhaps the] Higgs particle has been discovered and the existence of the Higgs field thereby confirmed.)
