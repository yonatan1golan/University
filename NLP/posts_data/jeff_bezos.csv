Jeff Bezos and Amazon board sued in row over satellites to rival Elon Musk’s Starlink,2023-09-01 11:37:57+00:00,357,70,"[{'author': 'TheTelegraph', 'body': ""**From The Telegraph's Matthew Field:**\n\nAmazon has been accused of ignoring a “glaring conflict of interest” when awarding hundreds of millions of dollars in rocket contracts to a company owned by Jeff Bezos.\n\nA lawsuit filed by an Amazon shareholder accuses the e-commerce giant’s board of acting “in bad faith” after handing a contract to Mr Bezos’s rocket company, Blue Origin, after less than 40 minutes of discussion.\n\nAmazon is planning to launch a vast network of more than 3,000 satellites that will provide internet access around the world.\n\nAs part of the plan, it must contract rocket companies to fire its satellites into space.\n\nAmazon has already paid about $1.7bn to three companies, including $585m to Mr Bezos’s Blue Origin. Its other contracts are with France’s Arianespace and United Launch Alliance.\n\nThe Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, which is bringing the lawsuit, said the rocket launch contract was the “second largest” in Amazon’s history, after its $13.7bn takeover of Whole Foods.\n\nThe legal claim alleges the company’s audit committee “inexplicably” did not consider awarding the contract to rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX, despite the rival company’s track record for successful rocket launches.\n\nSpaceX was not among the options presented to board members, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit argues the board had little role in negotiations. Instead, Mr Bezos and his team led the negotiations with a company he also owned, it is claimed.\n\n**Continue reading ⤵️**\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/01/jeff-bezos-amazon-blue-origin-satellites-elon-musk-spacex/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/01/jeff-bezos-amazon-blue-origin-satellites-elon-musk-spacex/)"", 'score': 15}, {'author': 'mryosho', 'body': ""at a quick check, F9 fairing is 5.2m wide... and ULA/Airiane is 5.4m and New Glenn is 7m (up from 5.4m).  maybe they made the (stacked) satellite specs just outside of SpaceX's capability on purpose?"", 'score': 6}, {'author': 'Tiny-Peenor', 'body': 'As much as I hate Musk, this deal has always been odd.

Electromagnetism is associated with electric and magnetic fields and with the particle of light, the “photon”.\n\nThe **Strong Nuclear Force** (a force that pulls and pushes on quarks, anti-quarks and gluons, and holds protons and neutrons together; a residual version of this force holds atomic nuclei together). This force is associated with the fields and particles called “gluons”.\n\nThe **Weak Nuclear Force** (a force which affects most known particles but is too weak to hold any known thing together; its main effect is to cause many types of particles to decay to other particles, and to allow production and observation of neutrinos.)  This force is associated with the fields and particles called “W” and “Z”.\n\nThe **Higgs Force** (an extremely weak force, not yet observed, which we expect to be present, now that a [and perhaps the] Higgs particle has been discovered and the existence of the Higgs field thereby confirmed.)
