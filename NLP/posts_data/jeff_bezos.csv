So if you live within the ‚Äútown limits‚Äù (what I can only assume is like, within 500 yards of the post office) you don‚Äôt get your mail delivered. That‚Äôs right! No mail delivery for you. You‚Äôre given a free P.O. Box, and if you can‚Äôt make it to the post office during the week because you work the same hours they do, well tough shit. They‚Äôre open until 11:30 on Saturday, so I hope you like getting your mail just once a week.\n\nThat‚Äôs not actually my rant though. What I‚Äôve come here to explain is what happens when you order goods through retailers who only ship via ups or fedex. If you get mail delivered to your door, you don‚Äôt realize just how many companies this encompasses, so take my word when I say it‚Äôs a lot. \n\nThey won‚Äôt take a PO Box address, you have to give them your street address for delivery -\nmakes sense, right? That‚Äôs how they deliver. The problem? USPS addresses are what inform your map services. That‚Äôs google maps, map quest, Apple Maps - if your home was built in an area where the USPS doesn‚Äôt deliver mail, your address is a big fucking question mark on those maps. Sometimes they point drivers to the right place, sometimes they don‚Äôt. In my experience, they almost never do. Whether or not I get a package from these shippers depends entirely on the driver that day - if he‚Äôs been around these parts a while, I (or one of my neighbors) might get the package. If not? Well, I‚Äôve had them delivered to people with my same last name, people with similar-enough sounding addresses (sort of?), people who I have no fucking idea why the delivery guy thought their address was close enough. The drivers who work for these companies are independent contractors and they can‚Äôt afford to dick around with ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù addresses. Lucky for me, I live in a small town as we can usually work it out. Most people don‚Äôt steal shit around here, and so far my packages have always made it to me...eventually. \n\nSo now let‚Äôs say we get rid of the USPS and you build a house anywhere. Who keeps up the address database? Because right now, that‚Äôs a free service provided by USPS, and that‚Äôs the reason I can‚Äôt get ups or fedex to deliver a goddamned package to my door - because I don‚Äôt have an address in the USPS database, which means my address depends on which map service you use, and they all pinpoint a slightly different location for my house. \n\nIf what I just explained sounds fun to you, then by all means, let‚Äôs let the USPS fail. If it sounds as miserable as it fucking is, let‚Äôs do everything we can to keep is solvent, m‚Äôkay?\n\nEdit: thanks for silver, kind stranger! I‚Äôve never been guided before and I couldn‚Äôt be happier about it happening on a comment about the necessity of the USPS. Call your congress person and let them know you don‚Äôt want to live life like I do, save the usps!\n\nEdit 2: Gold?!
