I mean ten years of this fucking shit and I am so fucking disgusted at the level of competency of Americans. These people are so fundamentally and totally broken.\n\n**EDIT**: So, because this blew up, and because I\'ve followed Elon for a long time and understand the way he operates pretty well, I\'m going to break down *exactly* why he gave two seig heils at the Republican conference.\n\nElon was a bullied autistic kid who has turned into a bully as an adult. The more money he\'s gotten, the worse he\'s become. There are countless, *countless* accounts of him being a fucking bully. He\'s always been a dick. No one really likes him. They voted to remove him from PayPal when he went on vacation - pretty much unanimously - because even *that* group couldn\'t tolerate him.\n\nHe\'s a con man. He understands what to say to appeal to an audience. When he only sells electric cars, he brands himself a crunchy SF liberal. When he wants to take over the world, he brands himself a far-right autocrat. \n\nHe has the mentality of a 14 year old, with the net worth of a small nation state. He lives in Troll Twitter, 4chan. If you know how those people operate you know how Elon operates. \n\nThey think they\'re smarter than everyone. When they share nazi shit, it\'s not because they deeply, in their heart, give a shit about ""the white race."" For Elon, the only race that matter is Elon. \n\nIt\'s because they enjoy pushing the buttons of ""the normies."" They like finding the things that rile people up, and then doing those things. If you\'ve spent any time around 14 year olds, you understand what I mean. If you\'ve been a 14 year old, you should know what I mean.\n\nElon knows Republicans are nazis that deny they\'re nazis. He understands them as well as any of us do. He knows the game. He is fucking with that game. Pushing it. Mocking them for it. \n\nTo bring this back, the reason that I bring up that he was a bullied autistic child, is to point out that **he harbors extreme contempt for ""normal"" society**. This is common in mistreated neurodivergent kids. They see all of mainstream society as the enemy. \n\nThis is his retribution. He doesn\'t *like* the Republican party. He doesn\'t *agree* with it. He\'s taking a giant steaming dump on these fools\' head. He\'s turning them into his flunkies, siccing one group of normies on another and watching them tear each other apart to sate a deep-seated loathing for neurotypical people and society.\n\nWhen he gives the nazi salute, he has two goals: \n\n* Dominate the headlines with the YouTube strategy of doing something so outrageous everyone *has* to cover you\n* Mock, and assert his dominance over, all the Republicans in that room by going *full* nazi **and forcing them to cover for him**. \n\nThat last bit is important. He wants to force them to dance for him. To humiliate themselves on his behalf.\n\n*He* isn\'t denying it. In fact he\'s continually *fueling* it and keeping it in the headlines. \n\nThis is to humiliate all those party officials and voters that he has the *utmost* disdain for, by making them bend into pretzels to do what he knows, and we all know, is a fucking heil hitler.\n\nIf you have paid attention to Elon for *any* amount of time this is painfully obvious. Like, so, so fucking obvious what he\'s doing, because this is who he is. He\'s a troll. He doesn\'t care that his actions will lead to genocide, because he has so much money he\'s not really a part of the human race anymore. \n\nJust like internet trolls don\'t give a fuck about the anonymous people on the screen that they piss off; Elon views everyone in that room, and all of us, as piexlated 1s and 0s that he is entitled to troll. \n\nAnd society, Republicnas, voters, the media - they all fucking prove him right. They prove they\'re the NPCs he thinks they are, by acting exactly as he knows they will, and loading his bank account up with money while covering him and praising him and whitewashing all his nazi antics. \n\nI\'ll leave you with my recreation of what I\'m sure is a very faithful recreation of what was going through his head that day. These are Elon\'s thoughts, plucked from his brain by me simply following the dipshit thing he Tweets and does and coming to the really obvious conclusion about how he thinks.\n\n> Ha ha, look at all these losers, Elon. So stupid. Not smart like you. I\'m sOoOooO much smarter than these NPCs. Look at all these fucking rubes! Just standing there. Clapping. \n\n> Omg Elon. You know what would be so fucking funny. Dude. You know what would be fucking *hillarious*? If I gave a heil hitler. Ha ha. Can you imagine? Can you imagine if I just gave a full fucking Nazi salute to these rubes? They\'d probably clap for me. They\'d clap. These stupid nazi rubes. I bet I could heil Hitler Trump to his fat face and he\'d just stand there. Ha ha. He wouldn\'t do shit, that fat bitch. He\'d probably salute me. They all would. They\'d applaud. And then the media would say it was a ""weird hand movement."" They wouldn\'t even be able to say it\'s a heil hitler. They totally wouldn\'t. Oh my god, I\'m going to do it. I\'m gonna do it. I\'ll make the front page of reddit too. On Trump\'s big day. Ha ha ha ha ha. Here we go!\n\n> Oh my God I did it. They\'re clapping! They\'re actually doing it! Look at these stupid fucks! Look at the look on Trump\'s dumb fat face! They\'re clapping me! I just did a Hitler and they clapped! Jesus these people are stupid. Ha ha Elon. These fucking NPCs. Ha ha. I can do *anything* I want. Literally anything. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.\n\nThere\'s a scene in *Sherlock* where one of the villains - a blackmailer who collects information on people to pressure them into doing what he wants - walks into Sherlock\'s apartment while he\'s talking, and calmly takes a piss on his carpet, and then leaves. \n\nJust to show he can. He doesn\'t really care about the piss, or the carpet. He doesn\'t care about anything, and that\'s the point. He does it because he can show how little he cares about it, and how no one can do fuck all to stop him doing it.\n\nThat\'s what Elon did. He pissed on the carpet of Trump\'s inaguration, because he knew no one would fucking stop him, and that\'s how little he thinks of the political party he\'s *in*.\n\n**EDIT 2**: \n\nTo clear up any misconceptions - none of Elon\'s actions are *because* he is autistic. It\'s simply a factor in the cocktail of who he is. It\'s not an excuse. It\'s not causal. \n\nThe nazi salute was not a tic, it was a calculated, intentional action to provoke a pre-meditated response. \n\nHis actions are because his profound wealth and awful personality, which he developed totally separate from his neurodivergence, have made him an emotionally-stunted narcissistic bully with no one in his life to love or who loves him. \n\nHolding everyone around you in contempt inevitably leads you to hold *yourself* in contempt, most of all, and that self hate eats at you like a cancer until nothing means anything in your life. \n\nHis fascination with ""simulation"" theory is not scientific, but almost certainly because his profound loneliness and depression causes him to dissociate regularly from reality, which is common with neurodivergent folks and which has the effect of making everything feel ""not real.""\n\nThe reason I am so confident he is autistic, is both because he has said he is in the past, but moreso because *I* am autistic (clearly), and game recognizes game. I can see how he thinks and why he makes the decisions he makes. \n\nBut as a bullied autistic kid myself, *I* got my needs met, I connected with my community, I worked on my relationships, and I now live a full, fulfilling life with a generous social calendar, a loving family, and I somehow manage to never seig heil on stage. Very easy not to, in fact.\n\nBut I can say - if you took 21 year old me, and you gave him hundreds of millions of dollars and allowed him to live entirely free of any consequences, and the media built me up to absurd proportions - I can\'t say that my life would have ended up as rich and enjoyable as it has been. \n\nIf you are autistic - understand that you\'re not alone, and that you don\'t need to feel like this. **Seek help**. Reach out to community. You are not broken. You are not defective. \n\nYou simply have a condition which causes you a great deal more sensations and thoughts than an average person has to deal with. It can be overwhelming, and you can be easily conditioned to view regular socialization as painful and bad, which it does not have to be if you understand yourself and seek out people you truly and deeply bond with.\n\nYou do not need to retreat to online forums. You just need to find real people in the world who are like you. There are fewer of them, but they exist, and when you find them you will connect with the human race and feel all the rich wealth of emotions that come with community and family.\n\n**EDIT 3**: Quick clarification, because I had a few people ping me on this: \n\nThis might be really in the weeds with the pysch talk, but *specifically* what I think Elon has, is my very specific cocktail of neurodivergence - auDHD, or a combination of autism and ADHD. \n\nIt\'s a very frustrating cocktail to deal with because they pull the brain in very different directions. My autistic self wants stability. My ADHD self wants chaos.
