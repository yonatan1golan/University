In the Army, if you don\'t spend your unit\'s budget for the year, the DoD figures you won\'t need the same or more for the following year so they\'ll reduce it. This is bad. What happens when you have new soldiers to train or want to do a fun training exercise that\'d make your dudes ready for war that following year? Sorry, don\'t have the budget. Anyways, this is a preface.\n\nI remember a time when my under-strength unit had 18k, as in thousand, rounds of 5.56 left plus 2k .50 cal. If we didn\'t fire it off, it\'d be reduced. Key words above is ""under-strength"". We ended up getting full up strength the following year. But I digress; my platoon went to the field for 5 days. 2 days was training with live ammo where I learned things. The other 3 was firing cyclic at nothing and collecting brass for turn-in.\n\nAnother reason for doing this at the end of every exercise for any spare ammo is you have to send an unlucky platoon to count every live round by hand while the platoon leader has to do a literal mountain of paperwork. Imagine you\'ve been crapping in a hole in the rain and cold for 14 days and you want to go home because you\'re tired and you\'ve not showered for two weeks. Would you like spending another six hours doing all of that and have to go through the lengthy procedures of storing weapons, vehicles, and nods? I didn\'t think so. In service terminology it is called a ""SPENDEX"". Short for spending exercise. \n\nJust for that ammo at $.50 cents per 5.56 and $2.50 for .50 BMG, that is $14G\'s that was mostly spent shooting the air. Not including gas, MREs, wet wipes, weapon PMCS, vehicle PMCS, and manhours for 60 servicemen and women for 14 days.\n\nNow imagine this story repeated across the army to every platoon every quarter. There are hundreds or thousands of combat platoons not including non-combat people who have to qualify. At the end of the day, soldiers are human and they want to just go home after training. It isn\'t rocket science. The DoD actively enforces policies that encourage soldiers to be extremely wasteful. Would you recycle your plastic if the government forced you to write a 20 page essay on the benefits of recycling every time you wanted to drop it off? Sure, ammo and explosives are dangerous.

He will indeed pay income tax when realising stock options, but one of the major problems with the US tax system is that once he\'s got them Musk can make money that is functional income - as in money that lands in his bank account for him to spend - without ever having to sell those shares and suffer capital gains tax OR class it as interest or dividends or a salary and pay income tax.\n\nHere\'s how it works: On November 1st 2016, Tesla was worth $27.5b at $37.88 a share. Musk owns roughly 25% of Tesla, which makes the value of his stake $9.47 billion. Let\'s say he wants $100million per year in spending money; banks will issue loans to a value of about 67% the collateral value, so he puts up about $1.5bil in shares as collateral on a $1bil loan (15.8% of his stake). Now interest rates for this kind of thing are dirt, dirt cheap; single figures cheap. Let\'s top that out and call it 9% interest, over a 5 year term. That\'s $90m * 5 = $450mil in interest, which he pays off with the loan money, leaving $110 million per year of doing billionaire-stuff money for him to blow, tax free, on whatever the hell he wants.\n\n5 years later, it\'s November 1st 2021. Tesla is now worth $1.1trillion. That 25% stake Musk owns is worth $275billion. His loan is due, so what does he do? He could sell a preposterously small percentage of his stake, pay the taxes, and then pay off the loan. But he doesn\'t do that, instead he goes to bank B and takes out another loan. This time he wants more doing-billionaire-stuff money, and he has to pay off his original $1billion loan. He takes out a loan for $4billion dollars, which requires nearly $6billion in collateral; this time that\'s just over 2% of his stake instead of nearly 16%. He will need to pay $1.8 billion in interest on top of his original $1 billion loan, so that leaves $4b - $2.8b = $1.2 billion of doing-billionaire-stuff money; $240 million a year. \n\nAt the _ridiculously low_ income tax rates we have today, Musk in the above scenario should have paid over $200million in income taxes during that first 5 year period, instead he can pay _absolutely nothing_. Not a single cent. All the while living the kind of lifestyle only a $110 million annual expenditure can buy you, and start the next 5 year period on twice that money having risked a fifth of what he originally did. This is why the ""But It\'s Not Actual Money In His Account"" defense is _so_ ridiculous; billionaires use their capital to access colossal amounts of cash _without_ having to sell their stakes; as long as their stocks appreciate at a rate more than twice that of the stupid low interest on their loans, they\'re laughing all the way to their bank.\n\nThe end game of all of this of course is that you die, and your heirs inherit both your assets and your liabilities. But here\'s the goofy thing; when they sell your stock, your heirs pay capital gains tax on the increase in value _from the point they inherited them_, not from whenever you originally got them. So if you die at the end of that second 5 year period with an outstanding $4 billion loan, your heirs simply sell $4 billion of inherited stock for $0 tax and pay off your debt - then go take out their own loan.\n\nObviously I\'m making these numbers up. For example, my 9% interest rate figure is total bogus, in fact this kind of thing [costs them around 0.85%](https://archive.md/j4vAG). Similarly the paltry $6bil of collateral I\'m using an example above is far wide of the mark; the actual value of Musk\'s shares tied up as loan collateral is [$112 billion](https://archive.md/Zm7ET) (92million shares at todays price of $1223).

I\'m pretty much stuck as far as what I can do by tax law because almost any move I can make to do anything but what I\'m doing already in life has HUGE tax consequences.  Yes, there are exceptions carved out for farmers but you have to structure how everything is titled, paid, filed, etc to be able to take advantage of it.
