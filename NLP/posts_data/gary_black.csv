But still, he might be good for the debate.\n\nWhy he might not be bad for liberals: \n\n1. He might attack Romney/Ryan on fiscal policy, showing Republicans that their candidates are not sincerely conservative fiscally, and arguing that they're both equally bad (black & white, no grays). This would either make Republicans rethink their love for Romney/Ryan, rethink their hatred of Obama/Biden, or rethink their commitment to pure fiscal conservatism as embodied by a libertarian. All of these could turn out well for Obama.\n\n2. He would be way more radical than Obama on foreign policy, challenging Obama on topics of foreign policy and domestic surveillance that many liberals honestly want answers to, and yet in doing so he would offer Obama the chance to appeal to conservatives who used to think of him as an anti-military, Muslim radical who is putting America in danger.\n\nHis being at the debate could also help Republicans: \n\n1. He would argue for small government, attacking President Obama more than Romney/Ryan, and having two people saying that Obama spends too much would make fiscal conservatives even more apt to think he's a radical.\n\n2. He could convince anti-war liberals who rank foreign policy as their #1 concern not to vote for President Obama, thereby helping the Romney/Ryan ticket.\n\n3. The GOP base is made up largely of law & order religious nationalists who wouldn't like the more liberal libertarian policies, so they probably won't change their votes.\n\nSo obviously, someone's gotta be wrong.
