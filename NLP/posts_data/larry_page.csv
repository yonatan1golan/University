(video 4 min)Google CEO Larry Page Says He Will Leave His Billions to Elon Musk,2016-11-17 15:03:33+00:00,40,9,"[{'author': 'carutsu', 'body': ""As I said in the video's comment section: Economic growth and scientific discovery is the strategy that has the most impact.If we would have stuck with charities in the 18th century, we couldn't even feed the current population. I think you dismissing the impact of scientific research and engineering in common people's lives is just shortsighted.\ufeff As Ford once said, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”"", 'score': 16}, {'author': 'halberdierbowman', 'body': ""I don't understand either of these guys' arguments. Do any of you think they're solid? It kind of sounds like neither of the reporters knows what SpaceX and Tesla specifically do, and just thinks that they're two random tech companies and that's why Page would consider the guy leading them.\n\nCompanies have administrative costs as well, so I don't think donating to Musk changes that as compared with a charity. Tesla and SpaceX do have to maintain some semblence of profitability, but so do charities. In some ways, can't charities have more problems remaining profitable, since they don't sell a product that people could invest in?\n\nFurther, giving money to Musk isn't the same as giving it to SpaceX and Tesla. Musk has already signed a giving pledge, so it's not like he would keep it. It sounds to me more like Page is picking a godfather for his children, someone whom he knows will take care of it if he can't, someone whom he knows shares similar ideals of improving the world and has the means to implement his ideas."", 'score': 5}, {'author': 'oliversl', 'body': ""The guy in the right is a little upset.

Assuming you cannot divide the sum of money up, you want to give it to whichever of the two organizations will have a higher, positive, net impact on the world.  It is obviously Musk that takes the lead in that race.  It\'s not like Page dishonored charities.  Even with his statement, it doesn\'t ""discredit"" charities as a whole, which is somewhat of a valid point the guy tries to make.  If a famous person tells the world that charities are inefficient people will most likely hear that and be more careful with that donations.  I think they guy is rather idiotic.  He is letting his initial emotional reaction dictate his judgement post analysis of the point Page is trying to get across.', 'score': 1}, {'author': 'apostolic3', 'body': 'The guy on the right is an arrogant jerk pretending to be a mind - reader of motives.
