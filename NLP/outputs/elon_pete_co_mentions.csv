comment,"Positive- Cramer is correct from wall street's point of view. The whole stock market is built mainly upon mismatched expectations. Don't lie to yourself, Elon is well known for being optimistic timeline wise. Negative- Cramer is a cunt for ignoring the bigger picture. Although Elon is over optimistic in terms of timeline, he always delivers. Every single time.- It's hard to be an entrepreneur without being optimistic, hence over promising. Being in a capital intensive industry, creating bleeding edge technology while battling the dealership assoc assholes doesn't help. It's bloody hard to be on schedule. Anyways, why are you guys downvoting this post? Because it's something negative on Elon? It is just from another perspective.",,,10,lidsky,
comment,If Jim Cramer is saying this about TSLA then its a strong BUY!The one thing that separates TSLA from other companies is I believe Elon Musk tells it like he sees it... which is unusual for a CEO of a public company.,,,2,neurotech1,
