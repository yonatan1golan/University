Please still vote for your second choice though, and vote in the General no matter what, even if your candidate doesn't make it.- Double check you are registered your registration can be cancelled, double check- Register to vote if you aren'tRemember, not voting doesn't make you immune to whoever wins. Their policies will still affect you, your children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. Vote for whoever you feel is the better candidate, even if they are only a very very small amount better.",,,1834,biobrownbear1834,
comment,"Here's the key passage""Do you believe, at any point in pregnancy, that there should be any limit on a woman's right to an abortion?"" Wallace asked. ""I think the dialogue has gotten so caught up on when you draw the line that we've gotten away from the fundamental question of who gets to draw the line,"" Buttigieg said. ""And I trust women to draw the line."" Wallace pointed to late term abortions and asked Buttigieg what his position was in back-and-forth. ""You would be okay with a woman well into the third trimester to obtain an abortion?"" Wallace asked. ""These hypotheticals are set up to provoke a strong emotional reaction,"" Buttigieg said. ""These aren't hypotheticals there are 6,000 women a year who get an abortion in the third trimester,"" Wallace said. ""That's right, representing less than one percent of cases a year,"" Buttigieg replied. The data from 2019 appears to support his claim, according to a Los Angeles Times report. ""So, let's put ourselves in the shoes of a woman in that situation. If it's that late in your pregnancy, that means almost by definition you've been expecting to carry it to term,"" he went on. ""We're talking about women who have perhaps chosen the name, women who have purchased the crib, families that then get the most devastating medical news of their lifetime, something about the health or the life of the mother that forces them to make an impossible, unthinkable choice."" ""That decision is not going to be made any better, medically or morally, because the government is dictating how that decision should be made,"" he said.",,,24586,ZigZagZedZod,

comment,Hang on... 5K through a bundeler is not the same thing as millions of dollars to a PAC. I'd like to know if Buttigieg even knew about it. It sounds like the Russians are giving token amounts to Dems just so it appears that both parties are on the Russian money train equally.,,,2873,JohnGillnitz,
comment,"READ THIS Buttigiegs support from the Blavatnik family, so far, runs in excess of 5,000, according to the FECclose to the maximum allowed by law.Heres what it was. Halfway through the article they say the actual amount.IMO, even as a Bernie supporter, this looks like it is just meant to be a news story which hates on Pete Buttigieg.Edit Additionally, the author is a clearly conservative person, who is in my opinion only writing this for a yellow headline, and a way to decredit ButtigiegEdit2 Seems more like just a yellow headline author. He writes 2 articles a day, and they all have just bad titles which hide the real information in the middle.Edit3 Thanks to vicarofyanks for this link which shows the hundreds of donations that have been given by the same person.Gild vicarofyanks not me pleaseEdit4 My comment was removed by rPolitics but should be back.Edit5 its not back, Edit6 its back!",,,2037,w-on,
comment,"Buttigiegs support from the Blavatnik family, so far, runs in excess of 5,000, according to the FECclose to the maximum allowed by law. And, since making the donations to Buttigiegs campaign, the Blavatniks have attempted to purchase influence as progressives maintain with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee DCCC as well, giving the Democratic Partys leading congressional incumbent protection organization well over 400,000Wait--so this Russian guy gave Buttigieg 5000 and he's being attacked for getting funded by a Russian-linked oligarch, but he gives 400K to help boost Congressional Dems and that doesn't make a headline.Curious.",,,79,ptwonline,
comment,"Compared to the serious millions Blavatnik donates to the people he seriously supports, 5000 to Buttigieg seems more like throwing a little mud splat to make the candidate took bad.",,,194,alvarezg,
comment,"Pete has not only been having closed-door fundraisers with billionaires, hes also stopped disclosing who his campaign bundlers are. No matter who you support, the Democratic field should push for openness in our elections. Dark money is the rot of our democracy. Edit heres the video Edit 2 Campaign Bundlers Also known as Super Fundraisers, Bundlers organize and collect campaign contributions from other donors. UPDATE Buttigieg to open fundraisers, disclose bundlers after criticism",,,1402,nnnarbz,

title,Fox News hit Pete Buttigieg with a gotcha question on Trump vs. Harris. It didnt go well for them,,2024-07-29 11:49:43+00:00,29987,,
comment,"Shannon Bream asked Buttigieg the Transportation Secretary who has been floated as Vice President Kamala Harris running mate if President Joe Biden was aware of how badly he had been doing in polling against Donald Trump.The answer wasnt what Bream expected, because she tried to interrupt, but Buttigieg wouldnt allow it.Im aware of how he was doing. Were all aware of how hes doing, Buttigieg said. Our country has watched our president lead, and yes, weve also seen the fact that hes 10 years older than he was 10 years ago. But unlike Republicans, who in Trumps personality cult will take a look at Donald Trump and say hes perfectly fine, even though he seemed unable to tell the difference between Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi, even though hes rambling about electrocuting sharks and Hannibal Lecter, even though he is clearly older and stranger than he was when America first got to know him.They say hes strong as an ox, leaps tall buildings in a single bound. We dont have that kind of warped reality on our side.On the contrary, the president confronted that reality in what must have been one of the most difficult decisions for an American president to make ever. And he did something that I dont think Donald Trump could even conceive of doing, which is putting his own interests aside for the country.",,,31446,MississippiJoel,

comment,"The ""offending"" tweet causing right-wing outrageSounds like he just wanted some privacy to make his own dining decisions.Pete Buttigieg's defense of it, and of the protestorsMr Buttigieg acknowledged that public officials should always be free from violence, but said they would never be immune from criticism and peaceful protests.Remember, the justice never even came into contact with these protesters, reportedly didnt see or hear them. And these protesters are upset because a right, an important right that the majority of Americans support was taken away. ... Since Ive been alive, settled case law in the United States has been that the Constitution protected the right to privacy and that has now been thrown out the window by justices, including Justice Kavanaugh, who as I recall, swore up and down in front of God and everyone including the United States Congress that they were going to leave settled case law alone.So yes, people are upset. Theyre going to exercise their First Amendment rights.Here is a clip of the interview60 Minutes did an interview with Pete Buttigieg not that long ago",,,5108,brain_overclocked,
